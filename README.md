# MissionWired Data Engineer Exercise
This repository contains my code submissions and output files for MissionWired's data engineering exercise. I used Jupyter Notebooks for data manipulation because I felt this was the best way to demonstrate the steps I took to clean and format the data. For your reference, the repository is structured as follows:

Notebooks
- [01-data-engineer-exercise.ipynb](https://github.com/ctnormand1/missionwired-data-engineer-exercise/blob/main/01-data-engineer-exercise.ipynb) - Code for Exercise 1
- [02-data-engineer-exercise.ipynb](https://github.com/ctnormand1/missionwired-data-engineer-exercise/blob/main/02-data-engineer-exercise.ipynb) - Code for Exercise 2

Output Files
- [people.csv](https://github.com/ctnormand1/missionwired-data-engineer-exercise/blob/main/people.csv) - Output from Exercise 1
- [acquisition_facts.csv](https://github.com/ctnormand1/missionwired-data-engineer-exercise/blob/main/acquisition_facts.csv) - Output from Exercise 2

## Instructions for Running Locally
You can clone this repository if you'd like to run the notebooks on your local machine. `Jupyter` and `Pandas` are the only dependencies. If you're using the Anaconda distribution of Python, you should have no problem. :thumbsup:
